NDEF library changelog
======================

===================================================================================================

v1.2.0 (October 20th, 2020)
Compiled with RFAL v2.2.0, tested on NFC03 and NFC06

The release brings many improvements.

Regarding the Poller layer specifically:
    - Improvements to comply with NFC Forum CR12 (systems tests based on NFC Forum CR12 Micropross test suite)
    - Support of transition to Read Only
    - Full support of T2T memory dynlock TLV and reserved area TLV

Regarding the Message layer specifically:
    - No adherence between the NDEF wrapper and the message layers, i.e. the message/record/type API can easily be reused
    - New types supported:
        o Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE (Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate, Low Energy and Secure variants)
        o Wireless Charging (WLC Capability, Status and Information, Poll Information and Listen Control)
        o Empty and flat types for internal consistency

Globally:
    - Compile time configuration for scalability:
        o Enable Read or Read/Write APIs
        o Embed only the NDEF types required
        o Ability to remove well-known type support for applications that do not need NDEF type handling
    - Bug fixes

===================================================================================================

v1.0.4 (July 22th, 2019)

Initial NDEF library release

The NDEF library provides an API to NDEF message and record management. 

The Software design is split in RF Technology-independent layer and RF Technology-dependent layer:
	- Message, record and supported types management layer (Technology independent)
	- NDEF wrapper layer abstracting the underlying technologies
	- NDEF Technology layer defining a common API on top of the RFAL (Technology dependent)

The NDEF wrapper on top of the NDEF Technology-dependent components allows to manage NDEF tags without
taking care of the underlying NFC Technologies.

The types currently supported are the following:
    - RTD Device Information
    - RTD Text
    - RTD URI
    - AAR (Android Application Record)
    - vCard
    - Wifi

The NFC technologies currently supported by the NDEF layer are: T2T, T3T, T4AT, T4BT and T5T.

See the ndef.chm documentation for further details and use examples.

Tested on hardware: Nucleo STM32L476RG + X-NUCLEO-NFC05A1 (ST25R3911)
Software dependency: RFAL above v2.0.4 (needs RFAL Higher Layer)
C99, MISRA C 2012 compliant
